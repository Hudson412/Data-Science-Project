    "text": "The data set used in this project, Valentine’s Day Consumer Data, is sourced from TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday is a weekly R project that encourages users to create visualizations using that week’s data set for wrangling and visualizing the data.\nThis particular data set is from the February 13, 2024 edition of TidyTuesday. Using information from surveys conducted by the National Retail Federation in the United States, we have information on how individual’s celebrate Valentine’s Day annually. The data in this project is form 2010 to 2022, thanks to Suraj Das’s work on Kaggle.\nIn analyzing the data set, I decided to look for a relationship between the average amount spent on Valentine’s Day gifts and the percent of individuals celebrating the holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing this chart, we observe a relatively negative correlation between the two variables. A possible trend that one could suggest through this visualization is that during years when there is a smaller proportion of individuals celebrating the holiday in a given year, those who do decide to celebrate are much more passionate about their gifts. This may give reason to why the average amount spent per person is marginally higher during years where the percent celebrating Valentine’s Day is lower in comparison to other years.\nConversely and more realistically, one could interpret the visualization in saying that as more people celebrate, total spending is spread across a broader population. A larger spread could possibly lower the average amount per person as the effect of an extreme outlier would not be as influential as it is in a year with less people celebrating. An average is a value that is greatly affected by outliers, but as the number of observations increases, the effect of the outlier weakens."

    "text": "The data set used in this project, Global Holidays and Travel, is sourced from TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday is a weekly R project that encourages users to create visualizations using that week’s data set for wrangling and visualizing the data.\nThis particular data set is from December 24, 2024. It was found through an article by Shengjie Lai (et al). The information presented is available thanks to funding from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The data was then curated by Jon Harmon. Sources for the data itself are cited below.\nIn analyzing the data set, I decided to look for a relationship between the time of year and the number passengers while separating individuals dependent on whether the flight was domestic or international.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a look at the chart, we can observe that travel seems to have a cyclical nature. During the summer months of the year, June - September, flights seem to pick up and more individuals are traveling. This shift seems realistic as individuals typically travel during the warmer months of the year and when their children are on summer break. Domestic flights also seem to pick up towards the end of the year (holiday season).\nAdditionally, domestic flights consistently have higher passenger volumes compared to international flights across all 12 months of the year. Normally, international flights stay below 30,000 passengers per month. With this idea, domestic travel shows much more variability in passenger numbers compared to international travel.\nCitations:\nLai S., Sorichetta A. and WorldPop (2020).
