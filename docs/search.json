Growing up in Pittsburgh, PA, I found the transition to living in California difficult at first but now love it. Professionally, I am currently pursuing a career in Investment Banking or Private Equity. Outside of professional and academic interests, I am currently training for an Ironman, love golfing, and enjoy playing poker in my free time."
