    "text": "The data set used in this project, Valentine’s Day Consumer Data, is sourced from TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday is a weekly R project that encourages users to create visualizations using that week’s data set for wrangling and visualizing the data.\nThis particular data set is from the February 13, 2024 edition of TidyTuesday. Using information from surveys conducted by the National Retail Federation in the United States, we have information on how individual’s celebrate Valentine’s Day annually. The data in this project is form 2010 to 2022, thanks to Suraj Das’s work on Kaggle.\nIn analyzing the data set, I decided to look for a relationship between the average amount spent on Valentine’s Day gifts and the percent of individuals celebrating the holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing this chart, we observe a relatively negative correlation between the two variables. A possible trend that one could suggest through this visualization is that during years when there is a smaller proportion of individuals celebrating the holiday in a given year, those who do decide to celebrate are much more passionate about their gifts. This may give reason to why the average amount spent per person is marginally higher during years where the percent celebrating Valentine’s Day is lower in comparison to other years.\nConversely and more realistically, one could interpret the visualization in saying that as more people celebrate, total spending is spread across a broader population. A larger spread could possibly lower the average amount per person as the effect of an extreme outlier would not be as influential as it is in a year with less people celebrating. An average is a value that is greatly affected by outliers, but as the number of observations increases, the effect of the outlier weakens."

    "text": "The data set used in this project, Global Holidays and Travel, is sourced from TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday is a weekly R project that encourages users to create visualizations using that week’s data set for wrangling and visualizing the data.\nThis particular data set is from December 24, 2024. It was found through an article by Shengjie Lai (et al). The information presented is available thanks to funding from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The data was then curated by Jon Harmon. Sources for the data itself are cited below.\nIn analyzing the data set, I decided to look for a relationship between the time of year and the number passengers while separating individuals dependent on whether the flight was domestic or international.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a look at the chart, we can observe that travel seems to have a cyclical nature. During the summer months of the year, June - September, flights seem to pick up and more individuals are traveling. This shift seems realistic as individuals typically travel during the warmer months of the year and when their children are on summer break. Domestic flights also seem to pick up towards the end of the year (holiday season).\nAdditionally, domestic flights consistently have higher passenger volumes compared to international flights across all 12 months of the year. Normally, international flights stay below 30,000 passengers per month. With this idea, domestic travel shows much more variability in passenger numbers compared to international travel.\nCitations:\nLai S., Sorichetta A. and WorldPop (2020).

    "text": "The data set used in this project, Netflix Movies and TV Shows, is sourced from TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday is a weekly R project that encourages users to create visualizations using that week’s data set for wrangling and visualizing the data.\nThis particular data set is from the April 20, 2021 edition of TidyTuesday. Using information conducted by Flixable, a third party Netflix search engine, we have data detailing the amount of titles that Netflix offers. The data in this project comes thanks to Shivam Bansal’s work on Kaggle.\nIn analyzing the data set, I first decided to look at Netflix’s title releasing activity within the United States. The chart is separated by content type, either Movie or TV Show. Secondly, I aimed to look at how the length of titles has changed over time. Finally, I looked at the frequency of titles starting with the articles “A” or “An” has changed over the past decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the produced chart, we observe an enourmous spike in title additions to Netflix. Starting around 2015, the company began to rapidly add more titles to their page. The pattern is evident in both Movies and TV Shows but more dramatic in Movies. Near the end of the graph we observe an extreme drop off that is likely due to the dataset being put together in the middle of the 2021. Otherwise, this shift could be a result of COVID-19 or other policy changes in titles.\nAnother key piece of information to keep in mind is that this chart specifically has to do with the United States, so international trends may differ. Much of Netflix’s audience is based in the United States, but they do have many users overseas. Many titles are available in only certain locations as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart is based off of all Netflix titles across the world, rather than just the United States. There doesn’t seem to be too much of an overall trend in either Movies or TV Shows. Movie titles showed significant volatility throughout the past decade with a noticeable uptick in 2016 that lasted until the boundary of this chart.\nTV Shows fluctuated even more extremely than Movies during the early portion of the chart. The value begins to level out/stabilize around 2012. This stabilization occurs at around 15-17 characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first three years of the chart, titles beginning with the articles ‘A’ or ‘An’ were quite rare. A steady increase begins in 2016, which continues to rapidly grow throughout the chart. Again, I expect the immediate drop in 2021 to be due to policy changes, COVID-19, or the fact that the data was collected halfway through this year.\nThe dramatic growth in these titles is likely connected to the idea that movies are often sorted alphabetically. If a title starts with A or An, then it would be listed at the top of Netflix’s page of media. Now, these articles are ignored, so the decrease in titles starting with the two articles could reflect producers realizing the placement of an article will not affect their placement in alphabetical content lists."
