Hi! I am a sophomore at Pomona College studying Math and Economics with a Minor in Data Science. Growing up in Pittsburgh, PA, I found the transition to living in California difficult at first but now love it. Professionally, I am currently pursuing a career in Investment Banking or Private Equity. Outside of professional and academic interests, I am currently training for an Ironman, love golfing, and enjoy playing poker in my free time.

Here are a few links with more information about myself and the code for this website.
